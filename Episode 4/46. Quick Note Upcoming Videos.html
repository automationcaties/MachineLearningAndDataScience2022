<p>In the upcoming videos we are going to start using a tool called PyCharm. It is a free tool that Python Developers use. If you want to follow along, we have an optional video next which shows you how to install PyCharm on your computer, but this is completely optional. You can also just watch the videos in the rest of the section to understand the concepts of Modules since we are using these concepts when working with Jupyter Notebooks. </p>
