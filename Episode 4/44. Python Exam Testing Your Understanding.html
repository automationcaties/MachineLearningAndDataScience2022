<p>We still have a long way to go in the course! However, now is a good time to test your understanding of Python and the python syntax. Below you will find 2 tests for you to take. Don't worry if you don't get everything right. There may be some questions in there that you won't know 100% because some of them will be covered in the Advanced Python sections of the course. The job of a programmer is to use google when you don't know the answer, so use whatever tools you have at your disposal to find the solution to your problem. <br><br>This test will come up again at the end of the Advanced Python sections so that you can compare your two results!<br><br>Once done, post your scores in the <strong>#python</strong> channel in our Discord community and tag me in it so I can "hopefully" congratulate you :)<br><br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PYTHON" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Test 1: 25 Questions</strong></a><strong><br><br></strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Test 2: 51 Questions</strong></a></p>
