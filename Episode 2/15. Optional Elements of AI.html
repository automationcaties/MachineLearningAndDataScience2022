<p>Massive effort getting through the first section! There was a lot to go through and if you're thinking, "wow this is too much...", don't worry, you're not alone. Machine learning is broad and learning a new skill takes time.</p><p>One place you might want to check out for some auxiliary learning whilst you go through the rest of this course is the <a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elements of AI</a> website.</p><p>It's got some great introductory explanations of many of the concepts involved in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Of course, going through the <a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elements of AI</a> material is completely optional. But if you need a break from coding (we'll be doing plenty of it), remember it's always there.</p><p>Now you've had an introduction to machine learning, let's get your computer set up for it!</p>
