<p>There may come a time where you want to share the contents of your Conda environment.</p><p>This could be to share a project workflow with a colleague or with someone else who's trying to set up their system to have access to the same tools as yours.</p><p>There a couple of ways to do this:</p><p>1. Share your entire project folder (including the environment folder containing all of your Conda packages).</p><p>2. Share a <code>.yml</code> (pronounced YAM-L) file of your Conda environment.</p><p>The benefit of 1 is it's a very simple setup, share the folder, activate the environment, run the code. However, an environment folder can be quite a large file to share.</p><p>That's where 2 comes in. A <code>.yml</code> is basically a text file with instructions to tell Conda how to set up an environment.</p><p>For example, to export the environment we created earlier at <code>/Users/daniel/Desktop/project_1/env</code> as a YAML file called <code>environment.yml</code> we can use the command:</p><p><code>conda env export --prefix /Users/daniel/Desktop/project_1/env &gt; environment.yml</code> </p><p>After running the export command, we can see our new <code>.yml</code> file stored as <code>environment.yml</code>.</p><p>A sample <code>.yml</code> file might look like the following:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">name: my_ml_env
dependencies:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - jupyter
  - matplotlib</pre><p>Of course, your actual file will depend on the packages you've installed in your environment.</p><p>For more on sharing an environment, check out the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Conda documentation on sharing environments</a>.</p><p>Finally, to create an environment called <code>env_from_file</code> from a <code>.yml</code> file called <code>environment.yml</code>, you can run the command:</p><p><code>conda env create --file environment.yml --name env_from_file</code></p><p>For more on creating an environment from a <code>.yml</code> file, check out the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Conda documentation on creating an environment from a .yml file</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>PS Thank you to Konstantin for pointing this out.</p>
