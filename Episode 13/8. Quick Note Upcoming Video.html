<p>The next video is from Andrei's course: <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/promotions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery</strong></a>. It is an optional video for those who want to learn how databases are used for applications for Mobile and Web, and how these databases gather data through transactions. If you watched the previous video, you will know that this video will be talking about OLTP databases. Enjoy!</p>
